# Arctic Challenge 2022

This repository is for contribution to the 2022 Arctic Challenge Hackathon in Skellefte√•, Sweden. 22-24 November 2022.

## Data collection framework for collaboration and co-presence in a virtual reality environment.
The challenge is to create a solution, for example, a VR framework, which collects and integrates data from several sources for virtual reality collaboration and co-presence applications with a particular focus on medical training, and to collect sample data with the framework and make standardized data cleanup for analysis.

### Requirements:
- Microsoft Hololens2
- multiple environmental and physiological sensors
- MongoDB account and database

### Overview:
The user has to create a MongoDB account, create a database, and retrieve the connection URI. The subarctic Python module contains implements the framework for extracting and loading the data, and manipulating the database.

### How to:

#### Setup
1. Make sure you have the required Python libraries. 
2. If not,  open up a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory of your  project. Once there, type the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### VR and Data Collection
1. On the HoloLens2, install an application. For our purposes, we loaded Basket Bin, an application that scans your environment and implements a VR basket and paper balls, and the user has 30 seconds to shoot the paper balls into the basket. Ideally, the selected application will be one in which the user has to move around, exerting a small-to-moderate amount of physical activity.
2. The user must connect to the physiological sensors, and record data while the activity is being performed.
3. Collect all data. Supported filetypes for the script is CSV

#### Data Framework / Storage
1. Clone this repositorty, and navigate to the directory the files are stored.
```
git clone https://github.com/briannaswan/2022-hackathon-ArcticChallenge.git
```
2. Create a Python script that does the tasks you want, utilizing the subarctic module. Otherwise, you can run example.py to create a new collection and import data to it.

```
python example.py
```

#### Using subarctic.py
This module when imported allows you to do the following functions: 

- Create an empty collection in a specified database.
  ```
  createCollection(URI, db_name, collection_name)
  ```
- Delete a collection and all of its contents.
  ```
  deleteCollection(URI, db_name, collection_name)
  ```
- Imports a .csv file at specified path to specified database collection. Returns: count of the documants in the collection
  ```
  importCSV(URI, csv_path, db_name, collection_name)
  ```
-  Uses a change stream to watch for changes in a specified database collection
    ```
    watchCollection(URI, db_name, collection_name)
    ```
-  writeArduinoData(URI, db_name, collection_name, serial_port, baud_rate)  
   ```
   Taking data from an Arduino connected via the Serial Port to a PC (USB), writes to a specified collection in the database.
